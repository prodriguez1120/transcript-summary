## Migration Summary

This report documents the migration from the old scattered configuration system to the new unified `settings.py` system.

## What Was Migrated

### 1. Company Configurations
- **Total Companies**: 2
- **Companies**: flexxray, techpro

### 2. OpenAI Configuration
- **Model**: gpt-4o
- **Max Quotes**: 30
- **Token Limit**: 128,000

### 3. Backup Files
- **Backup Directory**: config_backup
- **Files Backed Up**: 3

## Migration Steps Completed

1. ✅ Created backups of old configuration files
2. ✅ Migrated company configurations
3. ✅ Migrated environment settings
4. ✅ Created new unified settings system
5. ✅ Generated migration report

## Next Steps

### For Developers
1. Update imports in your code:
   ```python
   # OLD
   from env_config import get_openai_api_key
   from config_manager import get_config_manager
   
   # NEW
   from settings import get_openai_api_key, get_config_manager
   ```

2. Update configuration access:
   ```python
   # OLD
   config = get_env_config()
   max_quotes = config.max_quotes_for_analysis
   
   # NEW
   from settings import get_settings
   settings = get_settings()
   max_quotes = settings.openai.max_quotes_for_analysis
   ```

### For Users
1. The new system automatically loads from:
   - Environment variables
   - `settings.json` file (if exists)
   - Default values

2. Company switching works the same way:
   ```python
   from settings import switch_company
   switch_company("flexxray")
   ```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to the old system:

1. Restore files from backup:
   ```bash
   cp config_backup/env_config.py .
   cp config_backup/config_manager.py .
   cp config_backup/company_config.py .
   ```

2. Update imports back to old modules

## Benefits of New System

- **Single Source of Truth**: All configuration in one place
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic validation and type checking
- **Layered Configuration**: Defaults → Environment → Company → Runtime
- **Better Testing**: Easier to mock and test configurations
- **Cloud Ready**: Better support for multi-tenant and cloud deployments
