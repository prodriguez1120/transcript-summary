# FlexXray Streamlined Quote Analysis System

## Overview

This is the **current and recommended** system for FlexXray transcript analysis. It implements a sophisticated quote analysis approach that:

1. **Uses questions instead of bullet points** for better quote matching
2. **Implements quote ranking and reranking** for improved relevance
3. **Streamlines AI calls** for better efficiency and cost management
4. **Focuses on question-answer matching** rather than generic theme identification

## Key Features

### 1. Question-Based Analysis
Instead of generic bullet points, the system asks specific business questions:
- **Market Leadership**: "What evidence shows FlexXray's market leadership and competitive advantage?"
- **Value Proposition**: "How does FlexXray's value proposition address the risk of insourcing?"
- **Local Presence**: "How does FlexXray's local presence and footprint drive customer demand?"

### 2. Two-Stage Quote Ranking
1. **Initial Ranking**: Uses GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective initial scoring of 15-20 quotes per question
2. **Precision Reranking**: Uses GPT-4 for detailed analysis of top 3-5 quotes for final selection

### 3. Streamlined AI Calls
- **Reduced API calls**: Only 7 questions instead of complex multi-stage analysis
- **Efficient models**: Uses faster models for initial ranking, premium models for final selection
- **Better cost management**: Optimizes token usage and model selection

### 4. Robust Metadata Filtering
- **Interviewer detection**: Automatically identifies and filters out interviewer questions
- **Expert response validation**: Ensures only expert insights are included in analysis
- **Confidence scoring**: Provides confidence levels for metadata accuracy
