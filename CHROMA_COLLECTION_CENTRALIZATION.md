# ChromaDB Collection Centralization

## Problem
The `QuoteAnalysisTool` class was creating ChromaDB collections with potentially different metadata than the `VectorDatabaseManager` class, leading to:
- Metadata mismatches (e.g., different `hnsw:space` values)
- Silent query failures
- Inconsistent collection configurations
- Duplicate collection creation logic

## Solution
Centralized all ChromaDB collection creation in the `VectorDatabaseManager` class:

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Direct ChromaDB Initialization** from `quote_analysis_core.py`:
   - Removed `chromadb` import and direct collection creation
   - Replaced with `VectorDatabaseManager` import and usage

2. **Updated Constructor** in `QuoteAnalysisTool`:
   - Now uses `VectorDatabaseManager` for ChromaDB operations
   - Gets collection references from the centralized manager
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing collection attributes

3. **Added Helper Methods**:
   - `get_vector_db_manager()` - Access to advanced vector database operations
   - `store_quotes_in_vector_db()` - Centralized quote storage
   - `search_quotes_semantically()` - Centralized semantic search

### Benefits

- **Consistent Metadata**: All collections use identical configuration
- **Single Source of Truth**: Collection creation logic in one place
- **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to collection config only need to be made once
- **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and logging
- **Reduced Duplication**: No more duplicate collection creation code

### Usage

```python
# Create tool with centralized ChromaDB management
tool = QuoteAnalysisTool(api_key="your_key", chroma_persist_directory="./chroma_db")

# Access vector database manager for advanced operations
vector_db = tool.get_vector_db_manager()

# Use centralized methods
tool.store_quotes_in_vector_db(quotes)
results = tool.search_quotes_semantically("food safety concerns")
```

### Collection Configuration

All collections are now created with consistent metadata:
- `hnsw:space`: "cosine"
- Proper embedding functions attached
- Consistent error handling and validation

This ensures that queries will work reliably across all parts of the system.
